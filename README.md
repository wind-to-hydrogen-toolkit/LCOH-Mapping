(2023). ‘A geospatial method for estimating the levelised cost of hydrogen production from offshore wind’, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 48(40), pp. 15000–15013. Available at: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.01.016>.

## Highlights of the paper

- A geospatial model for estimating levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) production from offshore wind energy is described.
- The model is easy to use and versatile as the inputs are project variables such as water depth and wind statistics.
- LCOH from offshore wind is mapped for Ireland's offshore waters, and the results show significant spatial variability.
- A simple production function for rapid estimation of LCOH from a small number project variables is also presented.
